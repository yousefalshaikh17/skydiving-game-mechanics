# Skydiving Mechanics

### Overview

In 2023, I created a fun and experimental skydiving mechanic inspired by games like Fortnite and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This short-term project was designed to give players an immersive experience where they can control their descent through the sky. It features simple mechanics, such as steering and diving, while adding audio cues like the sound of air rushing to simulate the skydiving experience.

### Development & Features

The project was developed on Roblox and their Luau programming language. Key accomplishments included:

- **Steering Mechanics**: Players can steer based on the direction of the camera, allowing them to navigate freely through the sky.
- **Dive Mechanic**: By pressing a button, players can trigger a dive, causing their character to go headfirst and increase their fall speed.
- **Immersive Sound**: Added the sound of air rushing to simulate the skydiving experience, enhancing the sense of immersion.
- **Game Demo**: This mechanic is currently showcased in a simple demo game on **Roblox**, which can be found [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/13761014595/kip-testing-stuff).

### Real-World Applications

Although this was a fun experimental project, it helped me refine my skills in creating dynamic movement mechanics and integrating audio cues for immersion. The mechanic will eventually be expanded upon to create a boss fight demo where skydiving will play a role in the gameplay.
